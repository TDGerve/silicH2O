=============
In a nutshell
=============

|silich2o| is an open-source software program that uniformises and streamlines post-processing of silicate glass Raman spectra by providing an
interactive graphical user-interface. It can be used to: 

* interactively baseline correct Raman spectra  
* remove unwanted peaks through interpolation and unmixing  
* set up |h2o| calibrations with reference materials  
* quantify |h2o| contents of unknown samples.
